# How to use:

- Download the required files from the link in the drive folder 'implementation/server_files' and place them in the folder 'NotificationServer'

- Start the server using 'node server.js' ( while in the folder 'NotificationServer')

- Start this (while in the folder 'app-web-controller')

## For every participant: (Not impl. yet)

- Give them a short unique code e.g. VG5SL3.

- Write this same code into the 'PARTICIPANT CODE' textfield (This makes it possible to test multiple participants at the same time)

- Test that the participant can receive a message by clicking the "Test Messaging" button

- If it works, you are ready to begin. If not, check if the server is running at 'http://localhost:3001/' - if you get timed out the server is not running.

(note: if something goes wrong, you can simply hit the "reset" button to reset all the reps, sets etc. and start over)
